# AnonID - Decentralized Identity Verification System

A modern web application for creating, managing, and verifying Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on the Educhain testnet.

![AnonID Logo](src/components/Logo.tsx)

## Features

- üîê Create and manage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
- üîç Verify DIDs on the blockchain
- üíº Manage DID attributes and metadata
- üîó Built on Educhain testnet
- üé® Modern UI with AnonID branding
- üîí Secure wallet integration

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- EDU tokens on Educhain testnet (minimum 0.001 EDU)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Crimzor3086/AnonID.git
cd AnonID-
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
```
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
VITE_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url
```

## Smart Contract Deployment

1. Navigate to the smart contracts directory:
```bash
cd smart-contracts
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Deploy the contract:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network educhain
```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Connect your Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)

3. Ensure you have sufficient EDU tokens (minimum 0.001 EDU)

4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`

- `isDIDActive(string memory did)`
- `getDIDOwner(string memory did)`
- `setAttribute(string memory did, string memory key, string memory value)`
- `getAttribute(string memory did, string memory key)`
- `deactivateDID(string memory did)`
